BiliTrack – Portable Neonatal Jaundice Monitoring Device
Project Overview

Neonatal jaundice affects 60–80% of newborns worldwide and, if untreated, can lead to severe complications such as kernicterus, long-term disabilities, or death. In Rwanda, almost half of neonates require bilirubin monitoring, yet rural clinics face critical diagnostic gaps due to reliance on centralized laboratories. Conventional methods are either invasive, slow, or expensive.

BiliTrack was developed to address these challenges by providing an affordable, accurate, and portable solution for neonatal jaundice monitoring.

Problem BiliTrack Solves

Invasive and high-volume blood tests: Traditional serum bilirubin tests require 1.5–2 mL of blood, risking iatrogenic anemia in newborns.

Delayed results: Laboratory tests take 4–6 hours, delaying treatment and increasing the risk of complications.

Expensive or inaccurate non-invasive devices: Transcutaneous bilirubinometers are costly ($2,500) and may be inaccurate for dark-skinned neonates.

Limited rural access: Many clinics lack equipment and trained personnel for timely bilirubin screening.

BiliTrack bridges these gaps by offering a low-cost, accurate, and decentralized diagnostic tool.

How BiliTrack Works

Uses micro-volume blood sampling (<100 µL), minimizing stress and risk for neonates.

Applies dual-wavelength photometry (470 nm/525 nm) to measure bilirubin accurately while isolating interference from hemoglobin.

Validated using synthetic bilirubin phantoms, achieving 81% accuracy against laboratory standards.

Bluetooth-enabled for wireless data transmission, allowing real-time monitoring and integration with digital health systems.

Portable and affordable (~$130), making it suitable for rural clinics and low-resource settings.

Impact:BiliTrack enables timely, reliable, and accessible jaundice screening, supporting Rwanda’s healthcare goals and reducing preventable neonatal deaths. It aligns with Vision 2050, promoting innovative and equitable health technologies.
